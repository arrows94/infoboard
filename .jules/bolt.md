## 2023-10-24 - Layout Thrashing in requestAnimationFrame
**Learning:** Reading layout properties like `scrollWidth` and `clientWidth` inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop forces the browser to evaluate layout 60 times per second, even if `transform` is the only property being mutated.
**Action:** Always cache DOM layout measurements (like widths/heights) outside of high-frequency animation loops and recalculate them only when necessary (e.g., on loop wrap or resize event) to avoid unnecessary DOM reads.

## 2024-03-24 - Live Ticker Optimization
**Learning:** Moving the continuous JavaScript-based `requestAnimationFrame` ticker animation to pure CSS `@keyframes` on the compositor thread significantly reduces CPU usage and provides a noticeably smoother scrolling experience without layout thrashing.
**Action:** Always prefer CSS animations for simple, continuous translation (`transform: translateX(...)`) effects instead of manual JS frame loops. We replaced the manual loop with a cloned duplicate node mechanism inside a wrapper that animates cleanly to `-50%`.
